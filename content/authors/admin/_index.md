Im Qile Wang, a Ph.D. candidate from Zhejiang University. Im working with Prof. Jianmin Lin in Ocean College on ocean acoustics, which focuses on marine environment sensing and target detection based on distributed acoustic acoustic sensing (DAS).
My research focuses on marine environment sensing based on distributed acoustic sensing technologies, including marine biology, ships, and other underwater acoustic targets.
